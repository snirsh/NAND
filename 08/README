				   ---------------------------------

Submitted Files
---------------
README 	- This file.
VMtranslator.py -   The main program constructs a Parser to parse the VM input file and a CodeWriter to generate code
                    into the corresponding output file.
                    then march through the VM commands in the input file and generate assembly code for each one of them
Parser.py -         Handles the parsing of a single .vm file, and encapsulates access to the input code
CodeWriter.py -     Translates VM commands into Hack assembly code
VMtranslator -      executable of VMtranslator.py
Makefile -          a simple makefile for my python file. also has a tar clean and test options
