# The purpose of this file is to simply run your project, and the only line
# it should contain is the command you use to run your project.
# This file assumes that the main is contained in a class called Main that was compiled beforehand. 
# "$*" is a variable that holds all the arguments this file has received. So, if you
# run "Assembler-java trout mask replica", $* will hold "trout mask replica".
# Obviously, your project may be more complicated and require a different run file.
# For this file (Assembler-java) to run when you call "Assembler", rename it to "Assembler".
